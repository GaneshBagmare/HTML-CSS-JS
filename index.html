    <h1>Mountain</h1>
    <hr>
    <img src="mountain.jpg" alt="mountain Image">
    <p><i><b>A mountain</b></i> is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least <u>300 metres (980 ft)</u> above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges. <br>
    Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years. Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Himalayas, or Himalaya</strong>  from Sanskrit himá 'snow, frost', and ā-laya 'dwelling, abode', is a mountain range in Asia, separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has some of the Earth's highest peaks, including the highest, Mount Everest; more than 100 peaks exceeding elevations of 7,200 m (23,600 ft) above sea level lie in the Himalayas.</p>
